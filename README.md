## Project status

I am not actively developing this project, but I may return to it at some point in the future.
Typebeat is meant to be a cross-platform desktop app, but the current version only seems to work on macOS.
The Windows app crashes on startup, and I'm not sure why.
I haven't tested the Linux app.

- [Install Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
- Run `npm run-script init`
- Run `npm start` to start the dev process

## Building the website
