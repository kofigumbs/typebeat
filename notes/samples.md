# macOS Samples

The macOS GarageBand/Logic samples are royalty-free, but can't be packaged and/or distributed.
They're all located in these two locations:

 - `/Library/Application\ Support/Logic/*Samples`
 - `/Library/Application\ Support/GarageBand/Instrument\ Library/Sampler`

I should allow access to these via `Soundfile`.
